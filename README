ABOUT
PWWebViewController allows you to simply integrate an inline web browser into your iPhone/iPod touch application. It uses an UIWebView to display websites and provides basic controls such as back/forward, reloading a page, sending a link to the current page via email, opening the current page in Safari, landscape mode and error handling.

INSTALLATION
To use PWWebViewController simply copy PWWebViewController.h and PWWebViewController.h, which are located in the Classes directory, to your project and add them to a target (by default this is done by Xcode automatically). You also have to add PWWebViewControllerArrowLeft.png and PWWebViewControllerArrowRight.png, both are located in the Image directory, to your project. If you don't like the default arrows, you can simply replace them with your own PNGs. Since PWWebViewController uses the MessageUI framework add it as well. Make sure that the Base SDK of your project is set to iPhone OS 3.0 or higher. You should be able to build.

USAGE
To use PWWebViewController simply include PWWebViewController.h. You can use PWWebViewController like any view controller. If you push PWWebViewController to an UINavigationController's stack, it will hide the bottom bar and add a default toolbar.
